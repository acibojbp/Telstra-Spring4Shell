# Incident Postmortem: Spring4Shell Malware Attack

## Summary

This report details the postmortem analysis of a malware attack targeting a vulnerability in Spring applications **(CVE-2022-22965, Spring4Shell)**. The attack began on **March 20th, 2022** at **3:16:34 UTC** and was mitigated by implementing a firewall rule approximately two hours later. The Security Team and Network Team collaborated on the response. The severity of the incident is considered High due to the potential for data breaches, system takeover, and service disruptions.

## Impact

The impact of the attack is currently being assessed. While no confirmed compromise has been identified yet, the potential consequences could have included:

- **Data Breach**: Attackers might have been able to access sensitive data stored on the server.
- **System Takeover**: In a worst-case scenario, attackers could have gained complete control of the server.
- **Disruption of Services**: The attack could have disrupted critical services running on the server.

## Detection

The incident was discovered through analysis of firewall logs, which revealed a surge in suspicious requests targeting the `/tomcatwar.jsp` endpoint with methods like `POST` and potentially malicious headers. The Security Team identified these characteristics is consistent with Spring4Shell exploit attempts.

## Root Cause

The root cause of the attack was a vulnerability (CVE-2022-22965) in Spring applications. This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable servers through specially crafted requests.

## Resolution

The attack was mitigated by implementing a firewall rule that blocked requests with the following characteristics:

- **Method**: `POST`  
- **URI**: `/tomcatwar.jsp`  
- **Headers**:  
  - `suffix`: `%//>`
  - `c1`: `Runtime`
  - `c2`: `<%`
  - `DNT`: `1`
  - `Content-Type`: `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` (if legitimate traffic permits).

Following the implementation of the firewall rule, a significant decrease in suspicious traffic was observed, indicating successful mitigation.

## Action Items

**Immediate:**

- Investigate potential compromise across affected systems.
- Update all Spring applications to the latest versions that address the Spring4Shell vulnerability (CVE-2022-22965).

**Short-Term:**

- Review and update firewall rules to identify and block potential attack vectors.
- Conduct security awareness training for personnel to educate them on common attack methods and best practices for secure coding.

**Long-Term:**

- Implement continuous monitoring of network traffic and server logs to detect suspicious activity promptly.
- Review and update the incident response plan to ensure a coordinated and efficient response to future security incidents.
- Consider deploying a web application firewall (WAF) for additional protection against application-layer attacks.
